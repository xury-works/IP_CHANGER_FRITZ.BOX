# IP_CHANGER_FRITZ.BOX
This refreshes, and therefore changes the IPV4 of your FRITZ.BOX - ROUTER. Note: Only Fritz.box routers will be affected by this!
You can either use the "NOW" Button to change the IPv4 Address instantly after a few seconds, or you can choose to change the IPv4 every 10 minutes
by activating the timer on the left side, which is, by default, set on "OFF".
